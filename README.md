**Conclusion:**
Findings from the Charles river variable test:
The p-value from the T-test is 7.39e-05, which is less than 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis (H0). This indicates that there is a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles river compared to those not bounded by it.
Insights from the MEDV vs AGE analysis:
The p-value from the ANOVA test is 1.71e-15, which is way less than 0.05. This suggests that at least one age group has a different median house value compared to others. Further post-hoc tests can be conducted to identify which specific groups are different.
Relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and non-retail business acres:
The p-value from the Pearson correlation test is 7.91e-98, and the correlation coefficient is approximately 0.764. This indicates a strong and significant positive relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
Impact of distance to employment centers on median value of homes:
The regression analysis for the DIS coefficient has a p-value less than 0.05, indicating that the distance to employment centers significantly impacts the median value of homes. Specifically, for each unit increase in distance to employment centers, the median value of homes increases by approximately $1,091.6.

**Recommendations:**
Properties that are closer to the Charles river have a significantly higher value, suggesting potential areas of focus for property investments.
Homes that are further away from employment centers also tend to have higher values. Thus, while proximity to employment might be convenient, homes further away might offer better value or other amenities that increase their value.
Given the strong correlation between Nitric oxide concentrations and non-retail business acres, urban planning or zoning recommendations might consider how non-retail business concentrations impact the environment, and by extension, property values.
